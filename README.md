# musicbee-on-linux
This script installs musicbee on linux (currently arch and debian based flavors).

Simply run these commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/AlexAshs/musicbee-on-linux.git 
chmod +x ./musicbee-on-linux/install_musicbee.sh
./musicbee-on-linux/install_musicbee.sh
```

It will check, whether your ditribution is supported, install the necessary dependencies and even click the right buttons automatically during the installation process, so you don't have to.
After the installation is done, it will remove all unneeded dependencies.

Pull requests are welcome, as I only really use this on arch, but it could probably run on any linux distribution which supports wine.
